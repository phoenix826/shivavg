--------------
First release:
--------------

- AA on/off
- blending (at least the wrong way)
- VG_DRAW_IMAGE_STENCIL (use additional multitexturing blending modes ;)
- scissoring (use stencil buffer, mask other stencil usage to 1 bit)

- Write TODO describing exactly which functions
  are implemented and which are not + incomplete
  functionality for implemented ones

----------
Known bugs
----------

- approximate the radial gradient circle
  when drawing in some smarter way than
  with a fixed step

- outofmemory in arrays silently ignored

- blending doesn't use premultiplied colors

- gradient color ramp is not interpolated in linear space

---------------------------
Possible portability issues
---------------------------

- GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT for gradients
- multitexturing for VG_DRAW_IMAGE_MULTIPLY, VG_DRAW_IMAGE_STENCIL

-------------------------
Incomplete functionality:
-------------------------

- the only AA mode is multisampling
  (RENDERING_QUALITY_FASTER == RENDERING_QUALITY_BETTER)
- boundbox / point-on-path / tangent-on-path queries
- non-zero fill mode
- pattern paint
- masking
- image formats other than sRGBA_8888
- child images
- VGU warp matrices
- EGL (image drawing targets)

------
Bonus:
------

- gradient shaders? antialiasing shader?
